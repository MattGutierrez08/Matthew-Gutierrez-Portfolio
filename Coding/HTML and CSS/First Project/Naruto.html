        <h2 style="text-align:center;" >The story</h2>
    <p><b>Naruto Uzumaki</b> (Japanese: うずまき ナルト, is the titular protagonist of the manga <b>Naruto</b>, created by Masashi Kishimoto. As the series progresses, he is a young ninja from the fictional village of Konohagakure (Hidden Leaf Village). The villagers ridicule and ostracize <b>Naruto</b> on account of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox—a malevolent creature that attacked Konohagakure—that was sealed away in <B>Naruto's</B> body. Despite this, he aspires to become his village's leader, the Hokage, in order to receive their approval. His carefree, optimistic, and boisterous personality enables him to befriend other Konohagakure ninja, as well as ninja from other villages. </p>
    <p>When creating <b>Naruto</b> for the initial part of the series, Kishimoto kept the character "simple and stupid", while giving him many attributes of an ideal hero. Kishimoto gave <b>Naruto</b> a dark side by adding tragedy to the character's past. He has revised <B>Naruto's</B> image many times, providing the character with simple clothes to fit the young demography. Kishimoto changed his design for Part II of the storyline, which starts two-and-a-half years after Part I. Naruto is voiced by Junko Takeuchi in the original animated series and Maile Flanagan in the English adaptations.

        Merchandise based on Naruto includes figurines and keychains. <b>Naruto's</b> character development has been praised by anime and manga publications and has drawn scholarly attention. Although some initially saw him as a typical manga and anime protagonist comparable to those in other shōnen manga, others have praised his personality and character development as he avoids stereotypes typically seen in similar media. The character has also been the subject of researches in literature, making him stand out in fiction based on his traits and growth.

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <center><img src="images/Masashi.jpeg" alt="error with image" width=""></center>
        <p>After fans liked <b>Naruto</b>, Sasuke and Sakura to the three main characters from Harry Potter fantasy books, Kishimoto noted that both trios began their careers in a classroom, though he added that the similarity was unintentional. During the series' publication, Kishimoto married and had children. This influenced how he viewed Naruto's character. Naruto met his parents, and learned of their sacrifices in order to help him to control the Fox inside him so that he could protect their world. As a result, Naruto appreciated his life more and learned that his parents loved him, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience as a father. In the first chapters of the series, Kishimoto did not conceive the idea that Naruto would be the son of Minato Namikaze. However, as time passed on, the manga author made touches to Minato's face shown in the Hokage Mountain in Konoha to make them more similar to Naruto with an emphasis on their spiky hairs. However, in order to reduce too many similarities, Kushina Uzumaki's character was made to look like Naruto's face.

            Out of all the student-teacher relationships Kishimoto has created in the Naruto series, the one between Naruto and Jiraiya is his favorite. Right before Jiraiya's death in his fight against Pain in his last moments, he discovers the origin of Pain's multiple bodies and uses his last forces to send that message as a piece of advice to Naruto so that Naruto could defeat him in his place. This arc was the most difficult one to write; he felt this because Naruto truly forgave his enemy. Instead of having the protagonist kill the enemy he hates as happens in other series, Kishimoto found the idea of the two characters interacting and settling their differences more challenging. This had a major impact on the writer, and he decided to have Naruto forgive Sasuke during their final fight in a similar manner as he interacted with Nagato.[15] Kishimoto felt the need to create a story arc that would emphasize the tragedy of wars, leading to the final arc which would include a war. The principal reason for this was a significant difference between the two main characters, Naruto who had no knowledge of wars, and Sasuke who was a victim of one; his entire clan had been annihilated to avoid a potential civil war. As a result, Kishimoto created Nagato as a war victim who would Jiraiya, and act as Naruto's nemesis so he would understand the tragedy that Sasuke had experienced. As a result, Naruto's coming-of-age would have been completed in this arc and the final arc where Naruto deals with world war and develops a vision of the shinobi world as well as how he should handle the conflict.
            
            In 2013, when Naruto was reaching its climax, Kishimoto envisioned the idea of Naruto becoming a father. This resulted in the creation of Boruto Uzumaki, Naruto and Hinata's first child. Kishimoto wanted Boruto to act like his father, but at the same time, have differences between each other. Despite not wishing to reveal much about Boruto due to developments of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, he added that Boruto is not as direct as Naruto. In the 2015 film Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Kishimoto developed Boruto and Naruto's relationship from his relationship with his sons. In portraying the adult Naruto, Kishimoto did not want to make the character to give a cool impression in contrast to his younger days as a war hero because Naruto being a strong father figure to Boruto would be too boring for the narrative. Instead, Kishimoto wanted the film to depict the father and son relationship between Boruto and Naruto. Similarly, Chengxi Huang wanted to properly display Naruto's facial expression during this scene as stating that while Naruto has grown up ever since his introduction, his gentle smile was the same. Manga author Mikio Ikemoto claimed the scene in which Naruto helps his son to create a large Rasengan was his favorite at the time of drawing Boruto as across this moment he had to draw Naruto's past to the point he "felt the weight of NARUTO series and its long history behind it."</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Naruto's Six Path Sage Mode</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>This state is indicated with Naruto's pupils consisting of a cross of vertical fox-slits with horizontal toad-slits, and there is no pigmentation around his eyes that would otherwise signify the standard Sage Mode. Since Naruto first awakened this power, he has always used it simultaneously with the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode. Directly after obtaining Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki's power, Naruto's eyes are yellow and later orange with the various chakra modes he uses after the war, just like his previous ones before meeting Hagoromo. This mode increases the user's physical parameters well above that of Sage Mode and the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, as Naruto was able to kick away Truth-Seeking Balls before entering the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode with this power. As a heightened state of Sage Mode, Naruto's jutsu are augmented with larger amounts of natural energy to make them stronger. With the power he received from Hagoromo, Naruto gains a masterful grasp of chakra and the ability to comprehend all universal things. His sensing ability also rises to the point where he can sense and thus react to the invisible shadows in the world of Limbo.</p>
            <p>When Naruto uses his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode in conjunction with his Six Paths Sage Mode, he can push his abilities even further, such as being able to levitate, becoming fast enough to catch Kaguya Ōtsutsuki off guard and durable enough to take a Chidori unharmed.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:center;">Naruto's sage mode</h3>
            <p>Sage Mode is an empowered state that can be entered by blending natural energy with one's chakra, creating senjutsu chakra. Sage Mode allows users to tap into the natural force of the world, opening up new techniques to them and allowing them to power up existing ones with the new senjutsu chakra</p>
            
            <P>Sage Mode is known to be taught in two places: at Mount Myōboku by the toads and at Ryūchi Cave by the snakes. Users of Sage Mode must possess "extreme chakra levels" to invoke senjutsu. It is also important that their bodies be strong enough to support the increased power. Orochimaru, who discovered the Ryūchi Cave and gained the ability to mould Senjutsu chakra, was not able to use Sage Transformation to enter Sage Mode for this reason.[3]</P>

    <p>In order to enter Sage Mode, the gatherer must remain absolutely still in order to be one with nature and balance the natural energy with their own physical and spiritual energies. If the user puts too little natural energy into using senjutsu, the technique will not work. Conversely, if too much natural energy is taken in, their body will turn to stone forever; humans will also be transformed into whichever animal's school the senjutsu was learned from.

   <p>The toads of Mount Myōboku have devised several tools to make learning Sage Mode easier. By applying a special oil, the applicant's body will start passively taking in natural energy. This oil will evaporate if taken outside Mount Myōboku, thus rendering it useful only for learning purposes. The toads also have a special staff that, when struck with, knocks all the natural energy out of the gatherer, thus reversing any transformations before they can become permanent and the user turns to stone.</p>

    <p>At Ryūchi Cave, one must be bitten by the White Snake Sage, who injects them with natural energy. According to legend, if one's body is strong enough to withstand said injection, it will accept the power without reservation. If not, the snake will devour the person whole.[10]</p>

    <h3>KURAMA(Nine-Tails)</h3>
    <P>Kurama (九喇嘛), more commonly known as the Nine-Tails (九尾, Kyūbi), was one of the nine tailed beasts. Centuries of being regarded as a mindless monster and sought after as a tool for war caused Kurama to hate humans. After being sealed into Naruto Uzumaki, Kurama attempts to maintain its cynical perspective about the world, but with Naruto's insistence on treating it with respect, the fox overturns its hatred and willingly strives to use its power for the world's salvation.
    </P>
    <p>Kurama and the tailed beasts first came into being in the waning days of Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, who used his Creation of All Things Technique to divide the Ten-Tails' chakra into nine separate bodies and giving them each a name. Some time after being created, the Sage explained to the young tailed beasts that a link existed between them despite their separation. He also foretold of a day when they would be brought together again - though not as they were - and that at that time someone would emerge to show them what true power is. In the anime, before his death, Hagoromo sent Kurama to live in a temple built for the purpose of protecting it in a forest region with mountains that would later become part of the Land of Fire. Over time, Kurama gained a fearsome reputation as a natural disaster that can desolate areas where the darkest aspects of human nature collect and fester.

    During the time of the founding of the shinobi villages, the Gold and Silver Brothers of Kumogakure were assigned to capture Kurama, but were both swallowed whole by the fox. However, the two brothers survived and gained some of its power by eating the flesh of its stomach for two weeks, forcing Kurama to regurgitate them.</p>
    <p>After Madara Uchiha's defection from Konohagakure, he found Kurama and used his Sharingan to control it, forcing the fox to help him fight against Hashirama Senju, the First Hokage. The epic battle left a colossal scar in the earth that would come to be called the Valley of the End.[14][15] After his victory over Madara, Hashirama's wife Mito Uzumaki sealed the fox within herself, becoming its first jinchūriki.[16]

        Over the period of time which included the first two Shinobi World Wars, Mito kept Kurama at bay except when the seal nearly broke when she was going through childbirth. Towards the final years of Mito's life, it was decided that a new jinchūriki would have to be found, and that was another member of her clan, Kushina Uzumaki. Although Kushina was terrified when she learned of it, Mito comforted her young successor by telling her that by filling herself with love, Kushina would overcome the fox's hatred. This was shown years later that despite Kurama's constant attempts to destroy her hope for happiness as its jinchūriki and coerce her to break the seal, Kushina's love for Minato Namikaze and his love for her were proven to be strong enough to contain the fox.
        
        </p>
        <p>Soon after the end of the Third Shinobi World War, the Third Hokage made special arrangements for Minato to ensure that Kurama would remain sealed inside Kushina while she gave birth to Naruto on the night of October 10. However, despite keeping the childbirth a secret, a masked man called Tobi tracked down their location, killed their escorts, and held Naruto hostage, forcing Minato to quickly rescue him and teleport him to safety. Right after Tobi captured Kushina, he extracted and seized control of Kurama, and tried to have the fox kill its barely surviving jinchūriki, but Minato made it in time to save her. Soon afterwards, the masked man summoned Kurama into Konoha and ordered it to destroy the village.

        </p>
        <p>While Kurama was rampaging in the village, Minato fought against Tobi and soon managed to place a Contract Seal on him, which freed the fox from his control. Despite that, Kurama still harboured resentment against Konoha for sealing it away and continued decimating the shinobi forces that tried to repel it. As it prepared a Tailed Beast Ball, Minato summoned Gamabunta on top of the fox, and quickly teleported it to Kushina and Naruto's location, letting its Tailed Beast Ball detonate away from the village. Already dying from the extraction, Kushina used her remaining strength to restrain Kurama, planning to seal the fox back inside her so it would die with her. However, knowing that Kurama would revive without a host and how great a threat Tobi was, Minato instead came up with a plan to give his son the means to combat the masked man in the future.

        </p>
        <p>Because Kurama's chakra was too immense to be sealed within an infant, Minato first used the Dead Demon Consuming Seal to separate and seal its Yin half within himself, and then prepared the Eight Trigrams Seal to imprison the Yang half within Naruto. Realising what they were planning, Kurama attempted to kill Naruto, but both of the parents used themselves as shields and completed the sealing.[22] Later, upon awakening within Naruto's subconscious and learning the reason behind Minato's intention, Yang-Kurama, though frustrated of being sealed again, decided to wait for the time to come when it would influence Naruto as much as it can to use its power to break the seal.[23] Throughout the years, Kurama weakened the seal through the cracks of its formation by constantly leaking out small portions of its chakra, which had positive side-effects on Naruto such as amplifying his naturally large chakra reserves and healing ability, being able to heal from minor wounds within seconds to major injuries within a day.

            In the anime, it was revealed that Kurama had left behind large amounts of its chakra during the attack. Kazuma, a former member of the Twelve Guardian Ninja, collected and sealed the chakra within his son, Sora, hoping to make use of its power for his own agenda.
            
            Personality
            Kurama was characterised as a snarky and shrewd individual. It used "washi" (ワシ) when referring to itself, which is generally used by older men. Kurama expressed great pride in its power, believing itself to be the strongest of the tailed beasts due to its belief that their strength is determined by their number of tails, which earned Kurama nothing but disapproval from its brethren, especially Shukaku.[25] The fox would also react out of jealousy whenever Naruto was not using its power.[26] Conversely, Kurama openly acknowledged the fact that it alone doesn't stand a chance against the Ten-Tails,[27] and from its past experience with Madara, knew full well he was not an opponent to be underestimated, even when he was seemingly pushed into a corner.[28] Kurama held great respect to Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, as it was shown during the tailed beasts' youth that the fox shed tears after the Sage had imparted his final words to them.[7] Kurama's manner of speech was often harsh, but deep down it had a supportive disposition, as the fox expressed concern about its allies,[29] and gave some words of encouragement to Kawaki.[30]
            
            </p>
            <p>Centuries of receiving humanity's negative treatment caused Kurama to develop intense hostility and distrust against them, even going as far as proclaiming itself to be the living embodiment of hatred.[31] Ever since its sealing within Naruto, Kurama plotted to use his dependence on its power to break free from the seal. Eventually, after Naruto managed to best Kurama in combat,[32] the young shinobi then told the fox that he hoped to resolve its hatred someday.[33] Despite audibly reproaching him for making such a claim, Kurama nevertheless had developed a level of respect for Naruto and his determination, even noting that he was different from the humans it had previously encountered, therefore allowing its jinchūriki to utilise the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode without consequence during the early stages of the Fourth Shinobi World War. Later on, as Naruto told Son Gokū of his desire to save the tailed beasts and become friends with Kurama,[34] the fox — having witnessed all of the hardships and deeds Naruto had in his life — stood by to see if he could truly aid its brethren through his actions.[35] When Naruto successfully freed Son Gokū from Obito's control, Kurama finally became convinced of Naruto's word and offered to meld its chakra with his as a coalition, to which Naruto then removed the seal that restrained it and happily acknowledged the fox as his teammate and a member of Konoha.[36]

                Ultimately, Kurama formed a strong bond with Naruto; the fox would proudly declare itself as his friend and able to laugh with the boy, and admit that it had the utmost faith in Naruto's ability to carry on the legacy Minato and Jiraiya had left him, therefore abandoning its grudge against Minato for sealing it.[37] The two expressed trust in one another that Naruto would even allow Kurama to take control of his body and switch back without conflict.[38] It was later shown that despite its Yang half being freed from its seal in Naruto, the fox willingly complied to Hagoromo's request for it to return to Naruto. Over time, it came to care for Naruto's family, finding them entertaining to be around.[39] Its concern for Naruto was even shown when revealing the Baryon Mode,[40] hiding the great risk of its own life if Naruto used the power because Kurama knew that he would oppose using the power if he knew the truth, showing that it would even go as far to sacrifice itself for him.[41] In addition, thanks to its exploits during Fourth Shinobi World War and working alongside with Naruto, Kurama's peaceful existence expanded to the Five Great Shinobi Countries, as it would talk directly to the other Kage and assist over important matters.[42]
                
                Kurama also had a comical side of itself; the fox brazenly teased Naruto about his first kiss with Sasuke,[7] argued with him about each other's stubbornness,[43] and nervously lashed out at a joyful Naruto after the tailed beasts were freed from Kaguya Ōtsutsuki while flipping him off.[44] In the anime, Kurama came to fear Himawari after being incapacitated by a Gentle Fist attack used by her during an incident where Naruto had to shield Boruto from Himawari, who attacked him in anger for damaging her plushy.</p>
        <p>Kurama possessed vast and powerful chakra, the most of the nine tailed beasts alongside Gyūki,[57] and was required to be sealed last into the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path to avoid overloading it. It could also accumulate a huge amount of chakra shortly after it has used up most of its own, enough to be passed on to the entire Allied Shinobi Forces and be felt countries away by non-sensors.[59] Due to Naruto's compatibility with Kurama's chakra, any chakra it possessed is limited for its jinchūriki alone, unless it was moulded to fit the recipient's unique chakra signature.[60]

            When used by others, the chakra became dense enough to be seen as a visible shroud than can further protect the wearer. Using its chakra, Kurama could shroud itself within its Nine-Tails Chakra Mode to increase its power. As a last-ditch ability, Kurama could enter Baryon Mode. In this state, similar to nuclear fusion, Kurama's chakra was consumed as raw materials to produce a new type of energy. When in use, it dramatically boosted Kurama's reflexes, raw might, and chakra to extreme levels. Because all chakra is connected, the same power that is produced from bits of their lives also works to reduce the lifespan of opponents on contact. Due to its extreme energy consumption, Kurama must remain focused and not waste energy of extraneous thoughts and actions, to maximise the amount of time Baryon Mode can be maintained.[40]
            
            Kurama had a great deal of brute force, reputedly able to raise tsunamis and flatten mountains with just a single swipe of a tail.[61] Even with half its strength, it could overpower Obito's controlled tailed beasts,[54] smash Madara's senjutsu-enhanced Susanoo with a tail,[62] and with the Six Paths Chakra, battle Sasuke's Tailed Beast-enhanced Complete Body — Susanoo.[63] Kurama was deceptively quite fast, able to catch Naruto in Sage Mode.[64] The fox was also durable enough to withstand several senjutsu-enhanced attacks,[65] and block a Tailed Beast Ball from the Ten-Tails' initial form.[66]
