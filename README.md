# Welcome to my Portfolio
## Developed by Matthew Gutierrez
This website was designed by me to showcase my coding and artistic abilities.
   I am Matthew Gutierrez, and this is my first HTML 5 project. I began coding about two years ago by beginning with Code Combat, by using it I was introduced into the world of programming.
Once I finished Code Combat I began using Processing which was my first time writing code in lines and by using commands. 
With processing I made my first stickman by using cartesian coordinates, because I was brand new to coding it was quite a challenge.
But after the stickman, I began creating sphears that would make rainbow colors.
And then came C++, one of the most complex lanuages in comparison to Python, I used C++ for the fist time in Visual studio which was another programming platform for more advanced programming and it 
also used in GitHub. In Visual studio, using C++, made a calculator for math problems and for finding the area of a square, while also making other interactive calculators that would tell you your age
after typing in your date of birth. Eventually, I moved onto Scracth also made by the developers of Code.org. with that I made my own "Super Mario" style mini-game, the game would make you dodge obsticles
which were basketballs being dragged along the screen, and once you've made it past 3 levels the basketballs would be faster while more basketballs would appear, in the game you had different forms of moblility such as:
walking both straight and backwards while also being able to jump, crouch, and slide back and forth.
Then I made a clicker game that would have similar things to Cookie Clicker, the game was very interactive and fun to play.
