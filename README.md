# Welcome to my Portfolio
## Developed by Matthew Gutierrez
This website was designed by me to showcase my coding and artistic abilities.
   I am Matthew Gutierrez, and this is my first HTML 5 project. I began coding about two years ago by beginning with Code Combat, by using it I was introduced into the world of programming.
Once I finished Code Combat I began using Processing which was my first time writing code in lines and by using commands. 
With processing I made my first stickman by using cartesian coordinates, because I was brand new to coding it was quite a challenge.
But after the stickman, I began creating sphears that would make rainbow colors.
And then came C++, one of the most complex lanuages in comparison to Python, I used C++ for the fist time in Visual studio which was another programming platform for more advanced programming and it 
also used in GitHub. In Visual studio, using C++, made a calculator for math problems and for finding the area of a square, while also making other interactive calculators that would tell you your age
after typing in your date of birth. Eventually, I moved onto Scracth also made by the developers of Code.org. with that I made my own "Super Mario" style mini-game, the game would make you dodge obsticles
which were basketballs being dragged along the screen, and once you've made it past 3 levels the basketballs would be faster while more basketballs would appear, in the game you had different forms of moblility such as:
walking both straight and backwards while also being able to jump, crouch, and slide back and forth.
Then I made a clicker game that would have similar things to Cookie Clicker, the game was very interactive and fun to play. 
It had the basics of the popular "Cookie  Clicker" but was not so advanced. When I was done with that project, I was introduced to HTML5. This was when I was finally introduced to webpage designing, I first wanted to make it have a good theme, the point was to make a good webpage that looked and worked well. I first began with an HTML5 project that was a mini wiki about Naruto and the creator, I put gifs, pictures, and links to YouTube and other web pages. The theme was 
orange like his outfit and the theme of the show. The next step was to learn CSS for my original portfolio webpage, at the time my Portfolio was very simple and not so advanced. While practicing CSS I learned all the basics of CSS and learned 
what the possibilities CSS had to offer. 
Now that I had everything ready, I published my first HTML5 web page and portfolio.
